When using this data, please cite the following publication:

Each file contains the arboreal pollen sum and reconstructed woody cover for all pollen samples at a single site.  These files were generated for the specific purpose of making Figures 5 and 7 in Williams et al. 2009.

File naming convention:  APvsTC_[run code]_[site code].xls where [run code] is an internal code for the modern-analog analysis run used to generate the woody cover reconstrctions and [site code] is the Global Pollen Database (GPD) identifier for the site.  See Williamsetal2009GPC_SuppInfo_SiteTable.doc for a list of site codes, site names, coordinates, and publications.

Each file contains four subtables:
Subtable 1:  Arboreal Pollen Sum
Fields:
PD34dID:  unique record ID
Entity:  Global Pollen Database (GPD) ID for site 
DepthCM:  Depth (cm)
CalBP:  Calendar years before present, based on GPD default age model.
AP:  Percent arboreal pollen.

Subtable 2:  Woody Cover Reconstructions
Entity:  Global Pollen Database (GPD) ID for site 
CalBP:  Calendar years before present, based on GPD default age model.
NeedAvg11:  Needleleaved woody cover (%), for a 21km x 21km square centered on the site.
BroadAvg11:  Broadleaved woody cover (%), for the same area
Wood11:  Total woody cover (%), for the same area
Open11:  Open/unforested cover (%), for the same area

Subtable 3:  Few analogs
A list of fossil samples with <7 modern analogs

Subtable 4:  No analogs
A list of fossil samples with no modern analogs found.
